# RealTimeAutomaticNumberPlateRecognition
BY using Python Tensorflow Object Detection to be able to detect license plates using Kaggle Data. Once those plates have been detected we'll then be able to apply OCR to extract the text from each and every plate using PyTorch and EachOCR. 

1. Detect license plates from images and in real time from video 2. Apply a EasyOCR to license plates to extract the plate number 3. Save license plates detected for future analysis and searching
